# JSSBrawlStars-V35
aka JavaScript Server Brawl Stars version 35

## DO NOT USE IT IF YOU ARE NOT A **CODER**.
## THIS SERVER IS KINDA **UNFINISHED**. (so yeah, kids who just steal servers from github, changes two lines of the entire code and do it under their own authorship cannot use this server :sob:)

## - INFO

#### just a bad brawl stars server, created in javascript,  with (maybe) my shitty code and designed for you to finish it yourself.
#### working by [node brawl core](https://github.com/tailsjs/nodebrawl-core). author is [this awesome guy](https://github.com/tailsjs)

#### change IP in client and/or server if needed

#### in the terminal, enter
```bash
$ npm install
```

#### for run the server, u need enter in the terminal
```bash
$ node index
```

#### hooray!! the server is running!!


#### the server is taken and fully inspired from [serverbsvvv-brawl-v35](https://github.com/ServerBSvvv/ServerBSvvv-Brawl-v35)
#### some things is taked from [SpookyJS-Brawl](https://github.com/tailsjs/Spooky.js)

#### patched client is [this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NnoTQ_Ne04QDU43ID4I3-rWA938es1-6) (from [serverbsvvv-brawl-v35](https://github.com/ServerBSvvv/ServerBSvvv-Brawl-v35))
